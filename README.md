Wordle but different

My attempt at creating a WinForms version of Wordle.  It uses the dictionary from Wordle and lets you guess more than one word per day.  Some of the form navigation is a bit broken (Work in progress), I'll get to it one day.

TODO:

* Fix the form navigation, eg. stop you typing in guess two before completing guess one
* Make the textbox and button controls custom controls to remove duplication
* Show hints after a long time on a word
